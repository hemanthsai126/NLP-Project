MCS-90 Endorsement The endorsement does not actually provide insurance except on a reimbursement basis. For example, a standard unendorsed Insurance Services Office, Inc.

In either event, if the MCS-90 endorsement is attached, the insurer's obligation with respect to such a situation is determined by the MCS-90 endorsement provisions regardless. If the policy would provide such coverage even without that endorsement, the insurer pays the claim and the endorsement effectively has no impact on the issue. However, if the claim would not have been covered under the policy except for the MCS-90 endorsement provisions, the insurer pays the claim and then has the right to seek reimbursement from the insured.

    "answer": "Proximate cause is the cause having the most significant impact in bringing about the loss under a first-party property insurance policy, when two or more independent perils operate at the same time (i.e., concurrently) to produce a loss. Courts employ a set of proximate cause rules to resolve causation disputes when a property policy states that it covers or excludes losses \"caused by\" a peril and there is more than one peril at work in a fact pattern. Under common law, whether the policy provides coverage depends on which peril is chosen as the proximate cause. If the peril selected as the proximate cause is covered, courts consider the loss to have been caused by the covered peril and will hold that the loss is covered. If the peril selected as the proximate cause is uncovered or excluded, courts consider the loss to have been caused by the uncovered or excluded peril and will hold that the loss is not covered. As a principle of tort law, proximate cause refers to a doctrine by which a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions set in motion a relatively short chain of events that could have reasonably been anticipated to lead to the plaintiff's damages. If the defendant's actions were \"proximate\" or close enough in the chain of causation to have foreseeably led to the plaintiff's damages, courts will impose liability. Otherwise, if the defendant's actions set in motion a long, bizarre chain of events that could not have reasonably been foreseen to lead to the plaintiff's damages, courts will not impose liability. In tort law, multiple actions by one or more defendants that are a substantial factor in producing the loss can qualify as proximate causes.

    "answer": "\"Absolute\" exclusions are found within certain insurance policy forms and preclude coverage for claims that are remotely related to the actual nature of the exclusion. Additional Information The effect of an absolute exclusion's language is to defeat coverage in situations where it could be reasonably expected that coverage would apply. For example, an absolute exclusion in a policy written to cover insurance agents' errors and omissions (E&O) exposures might read as follows: \"This Policy does not apply to any 'Claim' against the 'Insured' ... based on or directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged 'bodily injury.'\" Assume, for example, that an insurance agent failed to secure bodily injury (BI) liability coverage for a client and the client is later held liable for BI. The client then sues the agent for failing to obtain an appropriate insurance policy. Given the wording of the \"absolute\" exclusion noted above, the agent's policy may not respond to the claim. This is because the client's allegation indirectly arose from and was \"related to\" BI. In recent years, these \"absolute\" exclusions have become more common, and insurers have, with increasing frequency, been using them to deny coverage of claims that would otherwise appear to be covered.",

Additional Information Over many years, even a small difference in the size of the fee charged to administer 401(k) plans can dramatically affect an employee's balance at the end of that period. Assume that investments within a 401(k) plan return 5 percent annually over a 40-year span of time. Also assume that an employee contributed $7,500 each year to the plan. If the employee paid a 2 percent annual fee during this period, he or she would end up with a balance of $565,509.45.

    "question": "What is Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)?",
    "answer": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is a 2010 law that enacted the most significant regulatory overhaul of the American healthcare system since passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Additional Information Following are the highlights of the PPACA. Health insurance market reforms, which include (1) health insurance policies are barred from having annual or lifetime coverage limits; (2) insurers must cover all applicants, with new minimum policy standards, and offer the same rates regardless of preexisting conditions or gender; (3) those with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage; (4) health insurers may not drop insureds who develop a medical condition; (5) parents with children up to the age of 26 can cover them under their own policies. Individual mandate: Everyone in the United States must purchase health insurance or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on their income tax return. Exemptions will be granted for financial hardship, religious objections, American Indians, prison inmates, those without coverage for less than 3 months, undocumented immigrants, people with incomes below certain tax filing thresholds (currently $9,500 for individuals and $19,000 for married couples), and those for whom the lowest cost plan option exceeds 8 percent of household income. Medicaid expansion: As of 2013, every state has different Medicaid eligibility requirements based on income, age, gender, dependents, and other specific requirements. Starting in 2014, states have the option, but not the obligation, to expand Medicaid eligibility levels to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). The expansion covers the gap for those who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for subsidies available under the individual mandate. Insurance exchanges: Directs states to establish insurance exchanges where individuals and small businesses can compare various insurers' healthcare plans, band together to form larger purchasing groups, and obtain coverage at more affordable rates. In states that choose not to establish such exchanges, the federal government will do so. Premium subsidies: Provides sliding-scale subsidies that reduce the cost of coverage. To be eligible for a premium subsidy, household income must be between 100 percent and 400 percent of the FPL. (Below 100 percent of FPL, the household qualifies for Medicaid. Above 400 percent of FPL, subsidies are no longer available.) Large employer mandate: Requires employers with more than 50 full-time employees to offer \"affordable\" coverage to their workforce or pay an annual penalty to the IRS. \"Full-time\" employees are defined as working 30 hours or more per week (which means the law does not apply to part-time workers). The amount of the penalty depends on whether the employer does or does not offer coverage and whether any of the employees receive a premium credit for purchasing individual or family coverage on a state-based exchange. Small employer subsidies: Offers a modest tax credit to small employers to help defray some of the cost of purchasing health insurance for their employees. To be eligible, a small business must meet the following criteria: (1) 25 full-time employees or fewer (meaning tax credit subsidies are unavailable for companies with between 26 and 50 employees); (2) average annual wage less than $50,000; and (3) employer contributes at least 50 percent to the premium cost.

    "answer": "An alteration of medical records exclusion can be found within the majority of physicians professional liability insurance policy forms with the purpose of eliminating coverage for claims involving the alteration of medical records. Additional Information The following scenario illustrates how this exclusion would apply. An anesthesiologist used the wrong type of anesthetic on a patient, given the nature and duration of the operation being performed. As a result of the error, the patient woke up before the operation was completed and eventually sues the anesthesiologist. But before receiving the lawsuit, the anesthesiologist changed the patient's medical record to indicate that he used the correct type of anesthetic. This exclusion would eliminate coverage for the patient's lawsuit, given the dishonest nature of the anesthesiologist's conduct in deliberately changing the patient's medical record in an attempt to absolve himself from liability. The rationale for this exclusion is that, in the vast majority of situations where physicians alter medical records, they do so in an attempt to remove or eliminate evidence of their medical negligence in treating a patient.

Additional Information Depending on the type of channeling program, the hospital and the physicians may or may not share limits of liability. The two advantages of channeling programs are cost effectiveness and a common defense team, which reduces the adversarial relationship when hospitals and physicians are named in the same malpractice suit. One downside of such arrangements is that they give the hospital considerable power over the claims administration process, so that physicians in a channeling program rarely have the authority to object to the settlement of a claim.",

    "question": "What is communicable diseases exclusion?",
    "answer": "A communicable diseases exclusion is an exclusion found within a substantial minority of physicians professional liability insurance policies that precludes coverage for claims caused by the transmission of communicable diseases. Additional Information The wording of this exclusion usually consists of two parts. The first part excludes coverage for claims caused by a physician's refusal to treat a person who has (or is suspected of having) a communicable disease. The second part of the exclusion eliminates coverage for claims in which a patient alleges that an insured physician transferred a communicable disease to the patient. The rationale for the first part of the exclusion is that, with proper precautions, even patients having communicable diseases can usually be treated without endangering the physician or other staff members. The rationale for the second part of the exclusion is that, given the nature of a doctor's work, a physician is usually in a good position to know if they have contracted a communicable disease. Therefore, physicians who are aware they have a communicable disease should not be practicing medicine until the disease is completely cured. Accordingly, many of the policies exclude coverage for claims involving a doctor who transmits a communicable disease to a patient they are treating.",

Ecclesiastical control involves consent or adherence to religious doctrine, unlike more secular forms of control.

Yet, because underwriters do not usually price their policies to incorporate such risks, claims resulting from experimental procedures are frequently excluded. (An example of such an experimental procedure is the implanting of a permanent intercranial device in hydrocephalus patients at Mexico's National Neurology and Neurosurgery Institute, which was alleged to be responsible for 370 patient deaths between 1994 and 2007, as reported in \"Experimental Medical Procedure Blamed for 370 Deaths in Mexico,\" Fox News Latino, November 12, 2011.)

The fee-for-services model contrasts with the value-based care model, in which physicians and hospitals are compensated based on achieving positive results (e.g., achieving a reduction in both initial hospital admissions and hospital readmissions for chronic conditions, improving the overall health of patients and maintaining that improvement over time), rather than on the sheer quantity of medical services they provide.

While insurance agents are not generally liable for an insurer's failure to pay a loss resulting from an insurer's financial impairment, there is certainly the possibility of a customer bringing an action alleging that the agent/broker was negligent in recommending the insurer. More favorable versions of this exclusion (for the agent/broker) \"except\" (and thus cover) claims against the agent/broker when, at the time coverage was placed, the insurer had received an A.M. Best's rating equal to or higher than some specified rating (e.g., A– or B+). In addition, some insurers will agree to modify this exclusion by endorsement to make it inapplicable to the insolvency of certain specifically listed insurers or to insurers that have received a Demotech Rating equal to or higher than some specified rating (e.g., A). It is important to note that these requirements apply to the rating at the time the policy was placed, which means that the insured agent/broker should be diligent about checking ratings every year. The rationale behind these types of exceptions is that if an insured agent or broker had arranged coverage with an apparently solvent insurer (as evidenced by an acceptable Best's or Demotech rating), the insured should not be penalized by forfeiting coverage.",

For example, a remote monitoring device has the potential to reduce the number of a patient's visits to either a doctor's office or a hospital for routine checkups. Wearable devices come with risks. For example, use of remote patient monitoring opens up the possibility that the hardware at the hospital or healthcare facility where remote readings are being received suddenly fails in some way or produces faulty readings.

Additional Information For example, the minister of trade in Country A may demand an annual $50,000 payment from Corporation X in return for allowing the corporation to ship its products into Country A. Corporation X's payment of such monies would constitute a violation of FCPA and could subject Corporation X and its directors and officers to liability in the United States. FCPA prosecutions have increased markedly in recent years. This, in part, resulted because the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx) requires that senior executives scrutinize their company's internal controls, certify its financial statements, and report possible FCPA violations to the company's board of directors, its audit committee, or its chief legal officer.

Additional Information The intent of the Act was twofold: (1) to ensure the solvency of defined benefit pension plans and (2) to encourage employee participation in defined contribution/401(k) plans by making it easier for employees to increase their retirement plan balances. Among the key provisions are (1) a requirement that a company must have in its defined benefit pension fund 92 percent of the money needed to meet its pension obligations in 2008, 94 percent in 2009, 96 percent in 2010, and 100 percent by 2011; (2) allowance of higher dollar contribution amounts for 401(k) savings plans, including \"catch-up\" contributions for older (i.e., 50 and up) workers; and (3) provisions allowing automatic enrollment of workers in 401(k) plans, whereby every new employee is automatically enrolled in the company's plan, unless the employee specifically opts out of enrollment. In December of 2008, however, defined benefit plan funding requirements (item 1) were relaxed considerably, given the fact that the stock market had suffered severe losses during the preceding year. This circumstance vastly reduced the assets of nearly every pension fund in the United States, thereby making it nearly impossible for such plans to comply with the more stringent funding requirements originally mandated by the Act.

Additional Information Ponzi scheme operators entice and secure new investors by offering higher rates of return than are otherwise obtainable in the marketplace. Another important characteristic of Ponzi schemes is that they require an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors to sustain the scheme. One notable, recent Ponzi scheme was perpetrated by Bernard Madoff (for which Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison) and considered to be the largest financial fraud in US history. The trustee for victims of the fraud estimated that investors lost $18 billion as a result of Madoff's fraud. The sheer volume of the scheme was, in part, made possible because Madoff had access to banks, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, charitable trusts, and other money management firms, which, in return for generous fees and commissions, channeled their customers'/clients' funds to Madoff. Investors brought numerous lawsuits against the directors and officers of these institutions, in which investors alleged that the money management firms were negligent in not discerning that Madoff's operation was fraudulent.

Additional Information Whether or not the but for evidentiary standard applies depends upon (1) the particular jurisdiction in which a case is filed and (2) the exact type of discrimination alleged. Under this standard, employee-plaintiffs must prove that the employer's discriminatory act for which a claim is being brought (e.g., termination, reassignment, demotion) was the primary factor that motivated the employer-defendant's particular action. For example, assume an employee is terminated for low productivity that had been documented during the previous 6 months. At the exit interview, the employee is referred to as \"one of our older workers\" by the company's human resources manager. Under the \"but for\" evidentiary standard, the worker must prove that he was terminated primarily because of his age and not as a result of low productivity. Although the remark about being an \"older worker\" may have been discriminatory, by itself, it would still not be sufficient to prove a discrimination case if the worker's lack of productivity was the employer's primary motivation for terminating the employee.

Additional Information Such coverage pays the costs associated with investigations of an insured corporation, although only those involving shareholder derivative claims. (Derivative claims are brought by one or more stockholders, on behalf of the corporation, alleging financial loss to the organization. Any recovery in such suits inures to the benefit of the corporation itself as opposed to the shareholders who institute the action.) However, investigations may also be required by various regulatory agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and others and for which there is no coverage under \"Side D\" of the policy. As part of an investigation, insureds must usually hire outside counsel, as well as various accounting, financial, and regulatory experts. Such parties assist the organization in managing document requests, responding to interrogatories, and providing depositions. There are three specific drawbacks associated with the investigations coverage contained within \"Side D\" of a D&O liability policy. First, coverage is limited to shareholder derivative demand investigations only. Second, the vast majority of insurers write Side D coverage with merely a $250,000 sublimit, a figure that is generally inadequate given the speed with which investigation-related costs can accrue. Lastly, virtually no excess D&O insurers will agree to provide \"drop down\" coverage once the $250,000 sublimit under \"Side D\" is exhausted.

    "answer": "Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance is a type of liability insurance covering directors and officers for claims made against them while serving on a board of directors and/or as an officer. What Is Directors and Officers Liability Insurance? Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance is a specialized form of coverage designed to protect individuals from personal losses if they are sued as a result of serving as a director or officer of a business or other type of organization. This insurance can also cover the legal fees and other costs the organization may incur as a result of such a lawsuit. In essence, D&O insurance acts as a form of \"management errors and omissions liability insurance ,\" safeguarding against the risks associated with the management decisions that have adverse financial implications. D&O insurance offers peace of mind to those in high-stakes decision-making positions. This coverage ensures that the personal assets of directors and officers are protected against claims that arise from decisions and actions made within the scope of their regular duties. Key Features of D&O Insurance One of the distinctive aspects of D&O liability insurance is that it is typically written on a claims-made basis . This means that the policy must be in effect both when the alleged wrongful act occurred and when the claim is made. This differs significantly from other types of liability insurance , where the policy in effect at the time of the incident is the one to respond. Another unique feature of D&O policies, especially when covering for-profit businesses, is the usual absence of an explicit duty to defend the insureds. This contrasts with many liability policies where the insurer has a duty to defend the insured against lawsuits. In D&O insurance, the insurer may have the right, but not the obligation, to defend the insured. This aspect requires policyholders to have a clear understanding of how their defense will be managed and funded in the event of a claim. IRMI's D&O MAPS offers detailed comparisons of over 300 directors and officers liability policies from the top insurers, highlighting broader and more restrictive provisions in different colors for informed decision-making. D&O policies also typically focus on financial protection against monetary damages. D&O insurance is designed to cover the types of losses that directors and officers might be liable for due to their managerial decisions, such as legal costs, settlements, and other court-ordered damages. This coverage stands in contrast with commercial general liability (CGL) policies, which often cover bodily injury and property damage. D&O insurance specifically excludes these types of damages. A critical point to understand about D&O insurance is its \" shrinking limits \" provision related to defense costs. Under this provision, defense costs, which can be substantial, reduce the policy's limits. This is an important consideration for policyholders, as it means that the costs of defending a claim can diminish the funds available for settlement or to pay a judgment. Also, it is another distinction from CGL insurance, where the limits are not typically impacted by the defense costs. Who Needs D&O Insurance? Directors and officers liability insurance is a versatile policy type that caters to a wide range of organizations. From for-profit businesses and privately held firms to not-for-profit organizations and educational institutions, the spectrum of entities that can benefit from D&O insurance is broad. For-profit businesses often face a myriad of risks associated with business decisions that can result in lawsuits. These can stem from shareholders, regulators, competitors, creditors, and even the company itself. D&O liability insurance offers protection to the individuals at the helm, ensuring that their personal assets are not at stake in the face of legal action. Privately held firms, while perhaps not facing the public scrutiny of larger corporations, are not immune to the risks of litigation. Internal disputes, employment practices liability , and financial performance can all lead to situations where directors and officers are held accountable. In these cases, D&O insurance provides essential protection. The role of D&O insurance is equally vital in not-for-profit organizations and educational institutions. Leaders in these organizations may not be dealing with the pressures of profit-driven businesses, but they still face legal responsibilities and the potential for lawsuits. The protection offered by D&O insurance ensures that these organizations can attract and retain qualified individuals, who might otherwise be reluctant to serve due to the potential personal financial risks. Understanding the A, B, and C Sides of D&O Insurance Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance is often structured into three distinct parts, commonly referred to as Side A , Side B , and Side C coverage. Side A Coverage: This is designed to protect the personal assets of directors and officers when indemnification by the company is not possible, either due to legal restrictions or financial insolvency of the company. In situations where the company cannot or will not indemnify its directors and officers, Side A steps in to fill the gap, providing direct coverage to the individuals themselves. This part of the policy is particularly important in severe cases where claims may threaten personal assets. Side B Coverage: Often known as \"company reimbursement\" coverage, Side B protects the company itself. It reimburses the company when it indemnifies its directors and officers, covering costs incurred from a claim against these individuals. Essentially, when the company pays the legal costs, settlements, or judgments for its directors or officers, Side B ensures the company is not left bearing these costs alone. Side C Coverage: Also referred to as \"entity coverage,\" it extends protection to the company itself for claims made directly against it. Side C is particularly relevant for publicly traded companies, covering securities claims made against the company as an entity. This type of coverage has become increasingly important as lawsuits often name both individuals and the company as codefendants. FAQs Q: Is D&O insurance only for large companies? A: One common misconception is that D&O insurance is only necessary for large, publicly traded companies. In reality, businesses of all sizes and types can face legal action against their directors and officers. Q: How does the cost of D&O insurance vary? A: The cost of D&O insurance can vary significantly based on several factors, including the size and type of the organization, the industry it operates in, the company's claims history, and the coverage limits and deductibles chosen. Tailoring a policy to an organization's specific needs is crucial for optimal protection and cost-effectiveness. Q: What role does D&O insurance play during mergers and acquisitions? A: During mergers and acquisitions, D&O insurance becomes particularly important. These processes can expose directors and officers to increased risks of lawsuits related to the management of the transaction. Having comprehensive D&O coverage ensures that leaders are protected against potential litigation costs arising from these complex corporate actions. Q: Is it possible to customize a D&O insurance policy? A: Yes, customization is a key aspect of D&O insurance. Policies can be tailored to address the specific risks and needs of an organization. Customization can include setting appropriate coverage limits, choosing between different coverage sides (A, B, C), and adding specific endorsements or exclusions based on the organization's profile. Q: How does a company determine the right level of D&O insurance coverage? A: Determining the right level of coverage involves assessing the organization's unique risk profile, considering factors like its size, the nature of its business, the regulatory environment, and its financial position. Consulting with insurance professionals who specialize in D&O coverage can provide valuable guidance in making this determination.

Additional Information There are two rationales underlying downsizing exclusions. The decision to terminate a significant portion of its workforce is largely within an insured organization's control, and insurers could be faced with catastrophic losses in the absence of the exclusion.

    "question": "What is employment practices liability insurance (EPLI)?",
    "answer": "employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) is a type of liability insurance covering wrongful acts arising from the employment process. Additional Information The most frequent types of claims covered under such policies include: wrongful termination, discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. In addition, the policies cover claims from a variety of other types of inappropriate workplace conduct, including (but not limited to) employment-related: defamation, invasion of privacy, failure to promote, deprivation of a career opportunity, and negligent evaluation. The policies cover directors and officers, management personnel, and employees as insureds. The most common exclusions are for bodily injury (BI), property damage (PD), and intentional/dishonest acts. EPLI policies are written on a claims-made basis. The forms contain \"shrinking limits\" provisions, meaning that insurer payment of defense costs which are often a substantial part of a claim reduce the policy's limits. This approach contrasts with commercial general liability (CGL) policies, in which defense is covered in addition to policy limits. Although EPLI is available as a stand-alone coverage, it is also frequently sold as part of a management liability package policy.

Many have criticized the rationale for this exclusion because intentional self-insurance even if an organization suffers a significant loss is often a sound business decision, especially in the long term.

    "answer": "The family exclusion is found within directors and officers (D&O) liability policies written to cover privately held companies. The exclusion precludes coverage for claims made by one family member/insured against another family member/insured. Additional Information The family exclusion's intent is to preclude coverage for claims involving either collusion or infighting. However, to broaden coverage, underwriters will sometimes agree to modify the exclusion so that only claims from members of the same generation are excluded. The effect of this modification would, therefore, be to allow coverage if, for instance, a son were to sue a grandfather or a daughter were to sue a father. In such instances, it is likely (especially when a member of the younger generation sues) that the younger generation will not have control of the business and may, in fact, be suing to prevent gross mismanagement of a family enterprise. Thus, when a member of a different, and typically younger, generation brings a claim, the possibility that it involves collusion or infighting is substantially reduced, which is why underwriters sometimes agree to this modification.

In effect, its limits are available to \"float\" between and among the limits provided under these (and other) types of primary policies when they are exhausted by claim payments. In the event that one or more claims exceed these primary/underlying limits, the limit of the floating excess policy can be applied in any combination up to the floating excess policy's limit to one or more losses.

    "question": "What is management liability insurance?",
    "answer": "Management liability insurance is a combination of critical coverages designed to protect directors, officers, managers, and business entities from exposure arising from governance, finance, benefits, and management activities. Also referred to as executive liability insurance, this includes directors and officers (D&O) liability, employment practices liability (EPL), fiduciary liability, and \"special crime\" insurance. These coverages may be written as stand-alone insurance policies or combined into a single \"package\" policy. Understanding Management Liability Insurance Management liability insurance is designed to protect the personal assets of corporate directors and officers , as well as cover the financial losses of the business entity, in the event of a lawsuit alleging mismanagement or similar allegations. The landscape of corporate governance includes risks like regulatory scrutiny, litigation from stakeholders, and financial uncertainties. Management liability insurance safeguards those that are managing these risks, and helps ensure that the challenges of business operations do not deter competent individuals from assuming leadership roles. For directors and officers, management liability insurance serves as a form of personal financial protection against claims that could arise from their decisions and actions taken in their official capacities. For the business entities themselves, management liability insurance provides a layer of financial security, helping to absorb the costs associated with defending against lawsuits, settlements, or judgments that may result from allegations of mismanagement. By offering coverage for a range of exposures including governance, finance, benefits, and management activities, management liability insurance ensures that both the individuals in leadership positions and the entities they serve are adequately protected. This protection in turn helps maintain the integrity and stability of the organization, allowing directors and officers to focus on the growth and success of the business without the looming threat of personal liability. Key Components of Management Liability Insurance Management liability insurance encompasses several critical coverages designed to address the unique risks faced by directors, officers, and organizations. Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance. D&O liability insurance protects individual directors and officers from personal losses if they are sued for alleged wrongful acts while managing the company. This insurance also protects the entity or organization itself, covering legal fees, settlements, and other costs associated with defending against such claims. Employment practices liability (EPL) insurance. EPL insurance covers claims from employees alleging violations of their legal rights, such as discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination , and other employment-related issues. This coverage is crucial for protecting organizations against potential lawsuits from current, former, or prospective employees. Fiduciary liability insurance. Fiduciary liability insurance protects individuals who manage employee benefit plans against claims of mismanagement. This coverage is vital for those responsible for administering, overseeing, or providing advice related to employee benefit plans. Kidnap, ransom, and extortion coverages. Kidnap, ransom, and extortion coverage addresses risks associated with criminal acts that could impact the organization. This component of management liability insurance is particularly important for companies operating in regions with high risks of such criminal activities , providing financial protection and support services during incidents of kidnapping, ransom demands, or extortion threats. IRMI's Professional Liability Insurance offers detailed analyses into E&O, medical, nonmedical, and management liability, enabling insurance professionals to evaluate policies, increase sales, and anticipate underwriter needs. Management Liability Package Policies Management liability package policies offer a streamlined and cost-effective way for businesses, especially small to midsized enterprises or not-for-profit organizations, to secure comprehensive coverage. Management liability package policies usually contain a set of common conditions applying to all the coverage lines purchased. In most cases, an insured must select a minimum of two types of coverage to be eligible to purchase a management liability \"package\" policy. This not only simplifies the management and administration of these policies but also often results in lower premiums compared to purchasing stand-alone policies for each coverage type. The bundled approach reflects efficiencies in underwriting and risk assessment, as insurers can leverage commonalities in the information required to evaluate different management liability coverage aspects. Management liability insurance package policies are particularly well-suited to privately held companies and not-for-profit organizations, with the potential for small publicly traded companies (e.g., those with annual sales under $25 million) to avail themselves of such coverage as well. These types of entities often face unique challenges and risks, which package policies can address more effectively and affordably than stand-alone policies. For larger publicly traded companies, which may have more complex risk profiles and greater exposure, stand-alone policies tailored to specific management liability coverage needs are more appropriate. Benefits of Management Liability Insurance Management liability insurance provides not only financial protection but also peace of mind for those in leadership positions. This coverage is indispensable in today's litigious environment, where allegations of mismanagement can arise from various stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, and regulatory bodies. By covering legal fees, settlements, and judgments, management liability insurance ensures that these challenges do not jeopardize the financial stability of the organization or the personal assets of its leaders. The benefits of management liability insurance extend beyond financial aspects, fostering a more secure and confident leadership environment. Knowing that there is protection in place allows directors and officers to make decisions and take actions that are in the best interest of the organization without the constant fear of personal liability. This confidence in decision-making is crucial for the growth and sustainability of any entity. FAQs Q: What distinguishes management liability insurance from CGL insurance? A: Management liability insurance specifically covers risks associated with the management activities and decisions of directors, officers, and the organization. It addresses financial losses and legal defense costs stemming from claims of mismanagement, employment practices violations, fiduciary breaches, and specific crimes such as kidnapping and extortion. On the other hand, CGL insurance provides coverage for bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury to third parties, rather than the management decisions of the entity. Q: Are there specific industries or types of organizations that benefit most from management liability insurance? A: While all organizations can benefit from management liability insurance, it is particularly important for entities that operate in highly regulated industries, have complex employment practices, manage significant financial transactions, or oversee employee benefit plans. Privately held firms, not-for-profit organizations, and small publicly traded companies also find great value in management liability coverage due to their specific risk exposures and governance structures.

    "question": "What is merger and acquisition litigation?",
    "answer": "Merger and acquisition litigation refers to a type of claim frequently made against the directors and officers of companies involved in merger activity. Additional Information Litigation often results from these situations because the directors and officers of both the acquiring and the acquired company face a number of conflicts and related obstacles in the event of a merger or similar business transaction. For example, the directors and officers of the company being acquired will be inclined to reject all buyout offers, no matter how favorable they may be for their company's stockholders. This is because such individuals are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the buyout. Similarly, the directors and officers of the acquiring company are confronted with the possibility that its own shareholders could allege that they paid too much for the company they have acquired. Given these (and other) exposures accompanying corporate merger activity, nearly every decision reached by directors and officers under these circumstances may be subject to attack as an alleged violation of their fiduciary duties. Accordingly, by 2010, 87.3 percent of all corporate consolidations were met with a merger objection claim, based on research by Matthew D. Cain and Steven Davidoff Solomon in Takeover Litigation in 2014, February 20, 2015. In response, underwriters of directors and officers liability insurance policies began adding special, higher retentions to their forms, which applied only to claims involving mergers and acquisitions. For example, if a policy contained a $100,000 self-insured retention (SIR), an insurer might impose a $500,000 SIR for merger objection claims.

    "question": "What is merger objection lawsuit?",
    "answer": "A merger objection lawsuit is one filed by dissatisfied shareholders of a company that is soon to be or has recently been acquired by another company. Additional Information Merger objection lawsuits usually name directors and officers of the acquired company as defendants, who shareholders believe have breached their fiduciary duty to protect their interests in the course of negotiating and consummating the merger transaction. Merger objection suits typically assert that the acquisition process was conducted in an unfair manner and that directors and officers may have had conflicts of interest that negatively impacted the structure of the acquisition, all of which operated to the financial detriment of shareholders. The acquired company and its directors and officers are almost always named as defendants in merger objection suits, but the acquiring company along with its directors and officers are also frequently named, particularly if the allegation is either (1) inadequate consideration (i.e., the per-share price shareholders were paid was too low) or (2) conflict of interest (directors/officers were unduly enriched personally by the acquisition). Damages associated with merger objection claims are relatively low (usually less than $1 million) compared with securities class action lawsuits. In addition to settlement amounts, merger objection claims also usually require that the directors and officers of both the acquired and acquiring companies provide more detailed disclosures about the actual merger transaction, along with the individual financial benefit they derive from it. However, from the standpoint of the plaintiffs' attorneys who represent shareholders, the real incentive for bringing merger objection suits is that settlements also typically incorporate monies for these plaintiffs attorneys' fees, which are often substantial, sometimes reaching into the low seven figures.

    "question": "What is misclassification claims?",
    "answer": "Misclassification claims are one of the two main types of wage and hour claims made by employees against their employers. Additional Information Misclassification claims allege that an employer has misclassified an employee (as \"exempt\" from eligibility for overtime pay) and thus has failed to pay overtime wages to that employee in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. (The other type of wage and hour claim is known as \"pay practices claims,\" which are composed of miscellaneous claims that are not wage and hour claims.) The FLSA established two broad classifications of employees, as follows: (1) exempt employees, who are those ineligible for, and thus \"exempt\" from, receiving overtime, and (2) nonexempt employees, consisting of employees who are not exempt and thus eligible to receive overtime pay. The following five categories of employees are \"exempt\" from receiving overtime pay: (1) executives, (2) administrative personnel, (3) professionals, (4) computer-related employees, and (5) outside sales employees. Insurers universally exclude indemnity coverage for both types of wage and hour claims (i.e., misclassification and pay practices) under employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) policies. However, a handful of insurers offer coverage for the costs of defending such claims, albeit subject to sublimits, typically $100,000 or $250,000.

    "question": "What is mixed-motive evidentiary standard?",
    "answer": "A mixed-motive evidentiary standard is an evidentiary standard that applies in certain employment discrimination cases. Additional Information Whether or not the mixed-motive evidentiary standard applies depends on (1) the particular jurisdiction in which a case is filed and (2) the exact type of discrimination alleged. Under this standard, employee-plaintiffs must prove that the employer's discriminatory act for which a claim is being brought (e.g., termination, reassignment, demotion) was merely a factor, but not necessarily the primary factor, that motivated the employer-defendant's particular action. For example, assume that an employee is terminated for low productivity that had been documented during the previous 6 months. At the exit interview, the employee is referred to as \"one of our older workers\" by the company's human resources manager. Under the mixed-motive evidentiary standard, to succeed in their claim, the worker need only provide some evidence that they were discriminated against on the basis of age, such as the remark about being referred to as an \"older worker.\" This is despite the fact that their lack of productivity was the employer's primary motivation for terminating them. Employees favor the \"mixed-motive\" standard because it requires a relatively low level of proof to support a discrimination case. Related Terms but for evidentiary standard",

    "question": "What is mortgage-backed security?",
    "answer": "A mortgage-backed security is a security, typically a bond, that produces periodic cash flows, using repayments from mortgage loans to fund such payments. Additional Information Between 2003 and 2006, unusually large numbers of subprime mortgage loans were pooled, packaged, and sold to investors in the form of bonds, which became known as mortgage-backed securities. In return for paying an up-front principal amount, these investors received periodic payments (usually quarterly), in the same manner as the holders of a traditional bond. By 2006, approximately 63 percent of all subprime loans were being sold and packaged in this fashion. When a wave of subprime mortgage loan defaults began in 2007, the value of these mortgage-backed securities began to plummet. This was because the cash flows that \"securitized\" the bonds (i.e., the periodic monthly payments from the subprime loans) were substantially lower than anticipated, given the numerous loan defaults. This, in turn, caused a shortfall in funds available to pay the interest mandated by the securities, bringing with it massive numbers of defaults by the issuers of the securities. Eventually, the securities holders brought literally hundreds of class action lawsuits against the directors and officers of the banks that made the subprime loans and the investment bankers who packaged the loans into securities.

Additional Information For example, negligent retention claims are often made after an employee commits a mass shooting at a plant or office. Injured workers then sue the employer, alleging that the company was negligent in not terminating the employee sooner.

    "question": "What is on-call employee?",
    "answer": "According to the Department of Labor (DOL), an on-call employee is an employee who is required to remain on call on the employer's premises and is therefore deemed to be \"working\" on call. Additional Information An employee who is required to remain on call at home or who is allowed to leave a message where they can be reached is not working (in most cases) while on call. However, additional constraints on the employee's freedom could require this time to be compensated. The terms \"working\" and \"not working\" are synonymous with \"eligible to be compensated\" and \"not eligible to be compensated.\" Therefore, the location of the employee while on call (i.e., whether they are on work premises or at home) is the main consideration that goes into whether compensation can be expected. However, this is not the only consideration. The issue of what constitutes an additional constraint on an employee's freedom is also a critical consideration. If an employee is able to \"engage in personal activities\" while on call away from premises, the on-call time will likely not be compensated. If, on the other hand, an employee receives so many calls that they cannot \"finish a meal, read a story to his or her child or read a newspaper,\" then there is a good chance the employee will need to be compensated for their on-call responsibilities.

Additional Information Opt-out lawsuits are most often filed by an institutional investor (e.g., a bank, insurer, or pension fund). By making a claim that is separate from the larger class action, an individual plaintiff can sometimes negotiate both a larger and more rapid settlement recovery than if the plaintiff was a more passive beneficiary of the class action lawsuit. In addition, by settling on an accelerated basis, an opt-out plaintiff gets \"first dibs\" at the defendant's directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance policy proceeds. This is important because the defense expenditures required by complex, protracted securities litigation rapidly depletes and frequently exhausts D&O policy limits, often before monies are available to make actual claim settlements.

    "answer": "Option backdating occurs when a stock option exercise date is set prior to the date on which the option was granted and at a lower exercise price than the current market price of the company's stock. Additional Information For example, assume that on January 1, 2014, a company's stock is selling for $25 per share. Also assume that the company's chief executive officer (CEO) is given a 4-year option grant covering the period from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2016, and that on January 1, 2012, the stock was selling for $15 per share. \"Backdating\" the option grant by 2 years in this instance allows the CEO to purchase the stock at $15 rather than at the current $25 per share price, thereby locking in an automatic profit. Option backdating is legal, provided the backdating is clearly communicated to stockholders and as long as the effect of the backdating is properly reflected in both earnings reports and tax payments.

In addition to providing job assistance, many legal authorities believe that when an employer offers outplacement services to a laid-off worker, it demonstrates good faith and therefore reduces the likelihood that the terminated employee will bring a wrongful termination lawsuit against their former employer.

For example, assume that an outside director sitting on a corporate board uses inside information to assist his own corporation in obtaining a contract with the company on whose board he sits. If a stockholder were to bring a claim against that director, a personal profit exclusion may preclude coverage for the claim. However, few policies apply the personal profit exclusion unless the claim of personal profit is factually established.

    "question": "What is retired directors liability policies?",
    "answer": "Retired directors liability policies are insurance policies designed to cover individuals who at one time served yet are now no longer serving on a corporate board of directors. Additional Information Directors are exposed to claims long after their tenure on a board has ended. In fact, the statute of limitations for such claims under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx) of 2002 is 5 years. Standard directors and officers (D&O) liability policy forms affirmatively cover retired directors, and for this reason, retired directors policies always apply as excess over the organization's policy. However, retired directors policies may still be needed because at the time a claim is made, (1) the parent company may not have a policy in force; (2) even if a policy is in force, the policy's coverage limits may be exhausted or inadequate; or (3) the current policy may exclude a claim for which coverage is not excluded under the retired directors policy. Another advantage of retired directors policies is that the retired director is the sole insured under such policies. As a result, (1) the insurer will focus its efforts on defending the insured's interests, which sometimes conflict with those of existing board members; and (2) the insured does not share policy limits with other persons. For example, directors who sat on the boards at Enron and WorldCom were required to use their personal assets to settle lawsuits filed against them because the corporations they served were financially unable to provide indemnification due to the companies' insolvencies and the exhaustion of their policy limits. Five former directors of Just for Feet paid a total of $41.5 million in conjunction with their service at the company, an amount that exceeded the combined Enron and WorldCom director-funded settlements.

    "question": "What is reverse merger?",
    "answer": "Reverse merger refers to a transaction in which an existing shell company (i.e., a publicly traded company with few or no actual business operations) acquires a private company with actual business operations. Additional Information In this situation, the private operating company takes over the public shell company. The value of reverse mergers is that they provide an inexpensive and rapid method of being listed on a major US stock exchange but without the need to go through an initial public offering (IPO). Another advantage of this approach is that it obviates the need to achieve compliance with US securities registration requirements. The end result of a reverse merger is that the private company takes over management of the public company and the stockholders of the private company become majority stockholders of the public shell company. According to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), numerous companies from the China region entered into reverse mergers in the United States between 2007 and 2010, whereby the Chinese companies were \"acquired\" by US shell companies as a means of being listed on US stock exchanges. This produced a rash of litigation against these Chinese companies, in which a number of accounting violations were alleged against both the Chinese firms and their directors and officers. This litigation has been termed \"Chinese Reverse Merger Claims.\" Related Terms initial public offering",

    "question": "What is right of recourse provision?",
    "answer": "The right of recourse provision is a provision in fiduciary liability policies giving an insurer the right to subrogate against an insured. Additional Information Subrogation is the process by which an insurer collects monies from a party responsible for causing a loss, for which an insurer has already made an indemnity payment. For example, assume that a fiduciary's negligence in administering an employee benefit plan caused a loss that was covered by a fiduciary liability policy. After the insurer pays that loss, a right of recourse provision would give the insurer the right to seek reimbursement from the fiduciary whose negligence caused that loss. Right of recourse provisions represent an exception to the general practice in the insurance industry whereby insurers do not subrogate against insureds. The right of recourse provisions have become relatively uncommon. In fact, few fiduciary liability insurers currently include right of recourse provisions in their forms. Instead, most fiduciary liability forms are silent as to the issue of subrogating against an insured. Related Terms fiduciary fiduciary liability subrogation",

    "question": "What is securitization?",
    "answer": "Securitization refers to the process whereby periodic cash flows from a given source are pooled, packaged, and sold to investors, usually in the form of bonds. Additional Information Between 2003 and 2006, large numbers of subprime mortgage loans were pooled in this manner and then sold to investors who, in return for paying an up-front principal amount, received periodic payments (usually quarterly) in the same manner as bondholders. By 2006, approximately 63 percent of all subprime loans were being sold and packaged in this fashion. When a wave of subprime mortgage loan defaults began in 2007, the value of the bonds began to plummet because the cash flows that \"securitized\" the bonds (i.e., the periodic monthly payments from the subprime loans) were substantially lower than anticipated, given massive numbers of loan defaults, and were therefore insufficient to pay the interest required by the bonds. This, in turn, triggered huge losses for the investors who bought these bonds. As a result, the investors brought literally hundreds of class action lawsuits against the directors and officers of both the banks that made the subprime loans and the investment bankers who packaged the loans into bonds.

Additional Information The leading proponent of this theory is sociologist William Bielby, who regularly testifies on behalf of employee plaintiffs in major employment discrimination cases (including those against Wal-Mart, FedEx, and Johnson & Johnson). As an example of unconscious bias, Bielby's research found that in identifying candidates for management positions requiring relocation, hiring managers systematically excluded women from consideration because they reflexively assumed that women weren't interested in jobs requiring them to move long distances. Critics of unconscious bias claims assert that while stereotypes are admittedly involved in interactions between strangers, when a Caucasian manager has known an employee for a significant time period, he will apply what is referred to as \"individuating information,\" thereby allowing him to make objective decisions on the basis of the employee's individual skills and abilities rather than on gender or racial stereotypes.

Additional Information The two major categories of wage and hour claims are those alleging (1) failure to pay overtime (to \"nonexempt\" employees who are not exempt from, and thus eligible for, overtime pay) and (2) miscellaneous pay practices claims, which include but are not limited to misclassifying employees as independent contractors, failure to grant rest and meal breaks, and failure to pay wages when due. In addition to covering wage and hour indemnity costs, the policies can be written with options that cover (1) the defense of wage and hour claims and/or (2) standard employment-related perils, such as discrimination, wrongful termination, and harassment. One drawback associated with wage and hour indemnity coverage is that (depending on the insurer), such policies require per-claim self-insured retentions ranging from a low of $250,000 to $1 million.

Unlike most other forms of insurance, under fiduciary liability policies, insurers sometimes exercise subrogation rights against insureds for non-willful or criminal acts.

Additional Information At least one federal district court has ruled that a business did violate Title III of the ADA by discriminating against a visually impaired customer who could not access the company's website. While there is no federal law requiring companies to adhere to specific Web accessibility standards, the World Wide Web Consortium (an international standards organization) has promulgated guidelines aimed at making website content accessible to people with disabilities.

Additional Information Significantly, the SEC will not provide awards for such information unless it produces actual monetary recoveries. Where the SEC recovers at least $1 million, a reward to eligible whistleblowers must be between 10 and 30 percent of the aggregate monetary penalties obtained by the SEC and other U.S. governmental entities, in any related actions. The SEC retains broad discretion in calculating the actual amount of the award. The factors that are considered in arriving at the amount include the significance of the information provided; the extent of the assistance provided; whether the whistleblower made use of a company's internal compliance function; whether the individual's actions put them in danger; whether the whistleblower encouraged others to assist the SEC; and the extent to which the whistleblower participated in the offense. The whistleblower provision also includes a number of so-called anti-retaliation measures that are designed to protect employees (and others) who report various types of corporate malfeasance. In addition to the heightened exposures created by whistleblowers' reports to the SEC, corporate directors and officers are also likely to face more numerous securities class action claims as a result of the whistleblower provision.

    "question": "What is cyber and privacy insurance?",
    "answer": "Cyber and privacy insurance is a type of insurance designed to cover consumers of technology services or products. Additional Information More specifically, the policies are intended to cover a variety of both liability and property losses that may result when a business engages in various electronic activities, such as selling on the Internet or collecting data within its internal electronic network. Most notably, but not exclusively, cyber and privacy policies cover a business's liability for a data breach in which the firm's customers' personal information, such as Social Security or credit card numbers, is exposed or stolen by a hacker or other criminal who has gained access to the firm's electronic network. The policies cover a variety of expenses associated with data breaches, including notification costs, credit monitoring, costs to defend claims by state regulators, fines and penalties, and loss resulting from identity theft. In addition, the policies cover liability arising from website media content, as well as property exposures from (a) business interruption, (b) data loss/destruction, (c) computer fraud, (d) funds transfer loss, and (e) cyber extortion. Cyber and privacy insurance is often confused with technology errors and omissions (tech E&O) insurance. In contrast to cyber and privacy insurance, tech E&O coverage is intended to protect providers of technology products and services, such as computer software and hardware manufacturers, website designers, and firms that store corporate data on an off-site basis.

Additional Information In this situation, the site doing the linking uses the intellectual property rights of the site to which it is linking to enhance the value of the first site. For example, consider a publishing firm that provides information on human resources policies and procedures to its customers. Its online material contains a number of links to a specific page within a human resources consulting firm's website. The consulting firm sues the publishing firm, alleging that the links violate the consulting firm's intellectual property rights. This is because the links enhance the publishing firm's website while bypassing the consulting firm's home page and minimizing the potential for compensation to the consulting firm. This is because the home page is from where the bulk of the consulting firm's advertising revenue comes.

Additional Information Such policies are most often termed \"cyber and privacy insurance,\" \"information security and privacy insurance,\" or \"cyber-security insurance.\" This insuring agreement covers the insured's liability for damages resulting from a data breach. Such liability most often results from (1) loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) in the insured's care, custody, and control, (2) damage to data stored in the insured's computer systems belonging to a third party, (3) transmission of malicious code or denial of service to a third party's computer system, (4) failure to timely disclose a data breach, (5) failure of the insured to comply with its own privacy policy prohibiting disclosure or sharing of PII, and (6) failure to administer an identity theft program required by governmental regulation or to take necessary actions to prevent identity theft.

Additional Information Some versions of this exclusion are even broader and preclude coverage for losses involving other types of portable electronic devices such as iPhones, iPads, tablets, and flash drives. The rationale for the laptop exclusion is that portable electronic devices are especially vulnerable to being lost, stolen, misplaced, or damaged. In addition, insurers believe that the more portable an electronic device is, the less control an insured business will have in safeguarding both the device itself and, more importantly, the data it contains. Some insurers will agree to remove this exclusion in exchange for additional premium. Favorable versions of this exclusion (for insureds) are those that \"except\" and thus cover losses involving portable computing devices or portable media containing electronic data if the data is encrypted.

Coverage under this insuring agreement would apply under the following circumstances: A retailer reports that the personally identifiable information (PII) (including credit and debit card information) belonging to its customers was stolen by a hacker. An investigation reveals that the breach occurred because the retailer's computer system did not comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In the event the retailer was fined $100,000 for failure to comply with applicable standards, this insuring agreement would cover the fines. Furthermore, if the retailer incurred costs to dispute the imposition of the $100,000 fine (because it felt that it did, in fact, comply with standards), this insuring agreement would cover those required defense costs.

    "question": "What is employers liability coverage (EL)?",
    "answer": "Employers liability (EL) coverage is provided by part 2 of the workers compensation policy. It provides coverage to the insured (employer) for liability to employees for work-related bodily injury or disease, other than liability imposed on the insured by a workers compensation law. Understanding Employers Liability Coverage Employers Liability Coverage (EL) and Workers Compensation are two fundamental components of workplace injury and illness protection, yet they serve distinct purposes. Workers Compensation provides statutorily mandated benefits to employees who suffer work-related injuries or illnesses, covering medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, and lost wages. In contrast, Employers Liability Coverage provides protection to the employer against lawsuits filed by employees who, due to work-related injuries or diseases, seek compensation beyond the benefits provided by Workers Compensation. This coverage is crucial in jurisdictions where Workers Compensation does not fully prohibit employee lawsuits for damages.Note that for policy coverage to be triggered, all five policy conditions must be met. In addition, there are fourteen policy exclusions. If any one of these is applicable, there is no coverage under the employers liability policy. Employers Liability Coverage specifically addresses the legal liability of employers arising from employee claims beyond the scope of Workers Compensation. Some of the types of claims covered include: Third-Party Over Actions: Third-party over actions involve situations where an employee is injured on the job, and a third party is deemed responsible. The employee may sue the third party, who then seeks to hold the employer responsible for the injury . Consequential Bodily Injury: Consequential bodily injury covers bodily injury to a family member of the employee that is a consequence of the employee's work-related injury. Dual-Capacity Suits: Dual-capacity suits occur when an employee sues the employer in a capacity other than as an employer, such as a manufacturer of a product that caused an injury. Care and Loss of Services: Compensation for the care and loss of services of a family member due to the employee's work-related injury. IRMI Workers Comp delivers comprehensive strategies and insights on workers compensation and employers liability insurance, offering up-to-date state-specific statutes, coverage analysis, and cost containment solutions. Importance of Employers Liability Coverage While workers compensation insurance serves to mitigate the employer's liability by providing statutory benefits to injured workers, it doesn't entirely eliminate the possibility of legal action. Employees may seek additional damages under certain circumstances, such as claims of negligence . Employers liability coverage steps in to protect the business's financial interests, covering defense costs, settlements, or judgments arising from such lawsuits. The financial implications of facing an employee lawsuit can be significant. Beyond the immediate legal costs, settlements, or judgments, there's the potential for reputational damage which can indirectly impact a business's financial health. Employers liability coverage may help ensure that businesses can withstand the economic fallout of legal battles with employees over work-related injuries or diseases. This coverage is particularly vital for small and medium-sized enterprises, where a single lawsuit can have a disproportionate impact on the firms' financial stability. FAQs Q: What is employers liability coverage? A: employers liability coverage is part of the workers compensation policy that provides protection to employers against legal liability for damages arising from work-related injuries or diseases that do not fall in the scope of workers compensation law. Q: Why do employers need employers liability coverage? A: Employers need this coverage to protect themselves against lawsuits filed by employees for work-related injuries or illnesses that seek compensation for benefits beyond the scope of workers compensation insurance. Q: How does employers liability differ from workers compensation coverage? A: While workers compensation insurance provides statutory benefits to employees for work-related injuries or illnesses, employers liability coverage protects the employer against claims that are outside the scope of the workers compensation act. Workers compensation insurance covers medical expenses, lost wages, and rehabilitation costs, whereas employers liability coverage protects against legal fees, settlements, or judgments arising from employee lawsuits when the employee's claim is covered by employers liability. Q: Is employers liability coverage mandatory? A: The requirement for employers liability coverage varies by jurisdiction. Note that in most jurisdictions, except those that are monopolistic, workers compensation and employers liability are bundled together in one policy with the employer's umbrella liability insurance (if purchased) sitting excess of the employers liability portion of the workers compensation policy when the employer's underlying employers liability limits are sufficient. Q: How can employers obtain employers liability coverage? A: Employers can obtain this coverage by purchasing a workers compensation policy that includes employers liability coverage. Additionally, stand-alone employers liability policies and employers liability endorsements are available in the marketplace. These products are mostly used in jurisdictions with monopolistic workers compensation systems since these systems do not offer employers liability insurance in addition to workers compensation insurance.

Additional Information In insurance parlance, this is a term that is included within the insuring agreement of many types of liability insurance. In a few cases, the word \"accident\" is a defined term within the policy. In most cases, however, common law becomes the determinant of what is or is not an accident for purposes of triggering coverage. In boiler and machinery (BM) insurance, \"accident\" is defined within the policy to mean a sudden and accidental equipment breakdown that causes damage to the equipment that necessitates repair or replacement. BM coverage applies to loss or damage resulting from an accident to a covered object. In liability insurance, particularly older forms, the insuring agreements typically covered injuries or damages caused by an accident that was not the result of a deliberated intended act (even if the intended act caused an unexpected result). The term accident was undefined in such policies. The coverage trigger in the insuring agreement of modern liability policies, such as the commercial general liability (CGL) policy, applies to an \"occurrence,\" which is defined to mean an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions. Unlike most other modern liability policies, the commercial auto liability insuring agreement continues to apply to injuries or damages caused by an \"accident.\" In this case, the policy includes a definition, of sorts, of the term \"accident\" that is, \"[a]ccident\" includes continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage.\" The personal auto policy's (PAP's) liability insuring agreement states that the insurer will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any insured becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.

    "question": "What is additional insured (AI)?",
    "answer": "An additional insured is a person or organization not automatically included as an insured under an insurance policy who is included or added as an insured under the policy at the request of the named insured. A named insured's impetus for providing additional insured status to others may be a desire to protect the other party because of a close relationship with that party (e.g., wanting to protect church members performing services for the insured church) or to comply with a contractual agreement requiring the named insured to do so (e.g., project owners, customers, or owners of property leased by the named insured). In liability insurance, additional insured status is commonly used in conjunction with an indemnity agreement between the named insured (the indemnitor) and the party requesting additional insured status (the indemnitee). Having the rights of an insured under its indemnitor's commercial general liability (CGL) policy is viewed by most indemnitees as a way of backing up the promise of indemnification. If the indemnity agreement proves unenforceable for some reason, the indemnitee may still be able to obtain coverage for its liability by making a claim directly as an additional insured under the indemnitor's CGL policy. In property insurance, additional insured status is most often used in conjunction with a premises lease agreement between the named insured as the lessee and the owner of the leased building, in which the insured tenant is required to purchase insurance on the leased building and name the building owner as an additional insured on the insurance policy with respect to the leased building.

    "question": "What is ensuing loss clause?",
    "answer": "An ensuing loss clause is an exception to an exclusion in a first-party property policy that applies in a special type of fact pattern where the damage caused by an excluded peril operates as a link in the \"chain of events\" that enables a covered peril to damage other property. Additional Information Symbolically, a classic ensuing loss fact pattern can be represented as follows: excluded peril → excluded damage → covered peril → ensuing damage. Note that there must be two kinds of damages an initial loss and an ensuing loss. Most courts will not apply an ensuing loss provision if an excluded peril caused a covered peril that results in only one kind of damage. Ensuing loss clauses were developed after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Earth movement caused about $80 million in property damage. Gas emitted from pipes broken during the shaking sparked a fire, which spread to the rest of the city and caused another $400 million in other property damage (in 1906 dollars). Symbolically: earth movement (excluded peril) → earthquake damage (excluded loss) → fire (covered peril) → fire damage (ensuing loss). Insurers argued that under the ordinary \"proximate cause\" rule, the earth movement was the peril that set the \"chain of events in motion,\" and that because earth movement was excluded, the fire damage was excluded, too. After the San Francisco earthquake, the California legislature enacted a set of statutes to prevent insurers from disclaiming coverage for fires ensuing from earthquakes. To comply with these and similar statutes in other states, first-party insurers added exceptions to their earthquake exclusions preserving coverage for ensuing fires. Later, ensuing loss exceptions were incorporated into many other types of exclusions.",

Additional Information Ice dams are common in areas that receive heavy snow buildups. In most cases, ice dams begin inside the house when heated air leaks up into the unheated attic. This phenomenon creates warm areas on the roof, causing the snow on its exterior to thaw. The melting snow moves down the roof slope until it reaches the cold overhang, where it refreezes. The process continues, causing ice to build up along the eaves and form a dam. Eventually, this dam forces the water to back up under the shingles and sometimes into the ceiling or wall inside the home. Ice dams may cause structural framing members to decay, metal fasteners to corrode, and mold to form in the attic and the wall surfaces. Few homeowners insurance policies pay for ice dam removal.

    "question": "What is inland marine coverage IM?",
    "answer": "Inland marine coverage is property insurance for property in transit over land, certain types of movable property that may not remain at a fixed location, instrumentalities of transportation (such as bridges, roads, and piers), instrumentalities of communication (such as television and radio towers), and legal liability exposures of bailees. Many inland marine coverage forms provide coverage without regard to the location of the covered property; these are sometimes called \"floater\" policies. As a group, inland marine coverage forms are generally broader than property coverage forms. Understanding Inland Marine Insurance Inland marine insurance is a specialized form of property insurance that has its roots in ocean marine insurance, which protects goods as they are transported across oceans. As commerce evolved and the transportation of goods over land became just as critical as ocean transit, inland marine insurance emerged to fill the coverage gaps left by standard property insurance policies designed to cover property at fixed locations. This coverage is used to insure a variety of property types, including property in transit over land, movable property that can be located at various places, and fixed properties that are instrumental in transportation and communication. Inland marine policies are also used to cover the legal liabilities of bailees , i.e., those who are temporarily entrusted with the property of others. Nearly all businesses require some form of inland marine insurance, since nearly all businesses need coverage on their property while in transit. It is particularly important for businesses involved in the transportation of goods or those that possess valuable equipment that moves between locations. Key Features of Inland Marine Coverage Many inland marine policies are called \"floater\" policies , since they provide coverage that moves with the insured property, offering protection regardless of the property's location. This is important for assets that are frequently in transit or moved from one location to another, such as construction equipment, artwork, and mobile medical equipment. Inland marine coverage forms are generally broader than standard property coverage forms. This is true with respect to covered causes of loss as well as covered locations. Standard property insurance policies typically impose more limitations on the coverage provided than inland marine policies. Also, compared to standard property insurance, inland marine insurance typically offers more flexibility when insuring unique assets. Standard property insurance policies often impose more limitations on the coverage provided than inland marine policies. It may be easier to tailor an inland marine policy than a commercial property policy to meet the policyholder's specific needs. IRMI's Commercial Property Insurance provides in-depth analysis and line-by-line interpretations of standard and nonstandard insurance forms, including ISO, AAIS, and NFIP policies, aiding agents, brokers, risk managers, and underwriters with detailed coverage explanations and providing practical advice. Who Needs Inland Marine Insurance? Inland marine insurance benefits a wide array of businesses and individuals. It is needed by all those with assets that are mobile or do not conform to the traditional categories of property insurance. Construction companies, for example, move equipment and tools from one job site to another, exposing these assets to various risks. Inland marine insurance ensures these valuable items are protected regardless of their location. Also, construction companies and owners of property under construction need inland marine builders risk insurance for a variety of reasons. One reason is to cover the property that will become part of the finished structure regardless of whether it is at the construction site, in transit, or at an off-site storage location. Retailers and wholesalers that transport goods and merchandise between locations or directly to customers also rely on this type of insurance to safeguard their products in transit. Service providers, including medical equipment providers and technology firms, require coverage for their equipment when it is away from the primary business location, making inland marine insurance an ideal solution. Additionally, artists and galleries dealing with valuable artworks that are frequently shipped to exhibitions or buyers need the specialized coverage options that inland marine policies offer. The need for inland marine insurance extends beyond businesses to individuals with unique items (such as antiques), mobile property (such as jewelry), or specialized equipment (such as golf carts or snowmobiles). Common Exclusions While inland marine insurance policies typically provide broad coverage, like other types of insurance, inland marine policies do contain exclusions. Common exclusions vary by coverage type, but typically include losses due to wear and tear , inherent vice (a quality of the item that causes it to damage or destroy itself), and employee dishonesty . FAQs Q: Can inland marine insurance cover items shipped overseas? A: Inland marine insurance primarily covers goods in transit over land. For international shipments, marine cargo insurance is typically required to cover goods in ocean transit. Property shipped by air may be covered under certain types of inland marine cargo policies, if air is included as a covered method of shipment. Q: Does inland marine insurance apply only to commercial entities? A: No, inland marine insurance is not exclusive to commercial entities. While businesses commonly utilize it for equipment, products, and materials in transit, individuals can also procure this insurance for personal property that meets the criteria, such as jewelry, high-value collectibles, or art that moves between locations. Q: Is there a difference between an inland marine policy and a floater policy? A: A floater policy is a type of inland marine coverage designed to cover property that moves from location to location, offering continuous coverage. While all floater policies are a form of inland marine insurance, not all inland marine policies are floaters, as some may cover fixed items such as bridges and piers. Q: How are premiums for inland marine insurance determined? A: Premiums for inland marine insurance are determined based on several factors, including the value of the insured items, the risk level associated with their movement or location, the coverage limits, and the deductible chosen by the policyholder. Q: Can I add inland marine coverage to my existing business insurance package? A: Yes, in many cases, inland marine coverage can be added to an existing business insurance package or commercial property policy. This can be a convenient and cost-effective way to ensure comprehensive coverage for movable assets or property in transit.

Additional Information MOPs were developed in the mid-1950s as a method of insuring in a single policy stock both during the manufacturing process and in transit. Because the MOP's combination of commercial property and commercial marine coverages met the needs of many different types of organizations, MOP eligibility also expanded over time to include many industrial, processing, and commercial operations. In recent years, the term \"commercial output policy\" and the \"COP\" acronym have begun to replace the term \"manufacturers output policy\" and the \"MOP\" acronym in the commercial insurance arena since they more accurately reflect the wide range of organizations that can be insured under this type of policy. The American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) offers standard COP forms and rules for use by its member insurers. In addition, many insurers have developed their own COP forms and rules. COP premiums are typically developed using a distinctive rating system (referred to as a \"deficiency point rating system\"), which allows many insurers to be more competitive using a COP than they could be using a standard commercial property policy.",

A margin clause may be used alone or along with another nonstandard commercial property insurance provision: a per occurrence limitation of liability provision. A per location limitation of liability provision is even more restrictive than a margin clause. It establishes that the most the insured can collect for a commercial property loss at a given location is the amount reported for that location on the insured's statement of values. When the two provisions are used together, the margin clause increases the amount that the insured could otherwise collect. Both provisions are typically attached to policies with blanket limits, so that they essentially convert blanket limits to specific, per location limits.",
